# Presto Security Working Group Governance

This document describes the basic governance principles for the Presto Security Working Group (the “Security WG”).

The Security WG operates as a working group under the [Presto Technical Charter](/https://github.com/prestodb/foundation/blob/main/Presto%20Technical%20Charter%2020191015.pdf/), which describes the responsibilities of the Presto Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”). The Security WG is established by the TSC as a working group pursuant to the Technical Charter. Accordingly, the Security WG will operate in accordance with the Technical Charter and Presto’s other policies and procedures, supplemented by the details below.

## Purpose

Identify, prioritize, and address security vulnerabilities in the Presto project, and work to improve the overall security posture of the project.

## Scope

* Establish processes for reporting and tracking security vulnerabilities.
* Collaborate with the Presto community to prioritize and address identified security vulnerabilities.
* Develop and implement security improvements and best practices for the Presto project.
* Coordinate security training and awareness initiatives for the Presto community.
* Provide guidance and assistance on security-related questions and concerns from the community.

## Principles

* **Openness** and **Transparency**:
    * Meetings of the Security WG shall be open to all participants who are dedicated to improving the security of the Presto project.
    * Decisions of the Security WG will be discussed openly in meetings, mailing list discussions, and/or issue threads.
* **Neutrality**:
    * The Security WG should operate in a manner which prioritizes the best interests of the Presto project ecosystem as a whole, and which does not privilege any particular vendor or distributor of Presto-related goods and services.
    * All activities of the Security WG shall comply at all times with the [Antitrust Policy of The Linux Foundation](/https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy//).
* **Technical merit**:
    * Decisions on security improvements and best practices should be based on technical merit, in light of the goals of aligning with the Presto project codebase and fitting with reasonable expectations of end users of Presto.
    * Participants in discussions should have the opportunity to share, discuss, and advocate for the merit of their views. However, not all views will necessarily be followed or implemented.
* **Objectivity**:
    * To the extent possible, decisions should be based on objectively-measurable criteria, rather than subjective considerations requiring personal evaluation and determination.

## Governance
* **Working Group**:
    * The TSC is establishing the Security WG as a working group of the TSC, pursuant to section 2(h)(iv) of the Presto Technical Charter.
* **Chairperson**:
    * The TSC will appoint an initial Chairperson of the Security WG.
    * The TSC may, in its discretion, remove the Chairperson and/or appoint a new Chairperson of the Security WG.
    * The current Chairperson will be listed on the [Security Working Group Github Project](/https://github.com/prestodb/security-wg/).
    * The Chairperson shall be responsible for:
        * scheduling regular meetings of the Security WG community;
        * facilitating open discussion among Security WG community participants;
        * assisting the Security WG community to seek to reach consensus;
        * recording decisions that are reached by the Security WG community;
        * documenting areas of disagreement where consensus cannot be reached, for escalation to the TSC; and
        * keeping the TSC regularly informed about the status of the Security WG’s efforts.
    * The Chairperson shall not be responsible for:
        * deciding the outcome of technical decisions if consensus cannot be reached.
* **Meetings**:
    * Participants in the meetings shall comply with the [Presto Foundation Code of Conduct](/https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md/) and all other policies of the Presto Foundation and The Linux Foundation.
* **Decisions**:
    * The Security WG aims to operate as a consensus-based community.
    * If there are any decisions where consensus cannot be reached, the Chairperson may escalate the decision to the TSC to resolve the decision according to the Technical Charter.
* **Amendments**:
    * The TSC may, in its discretion, amend this Working Group Governance document from time to time.
